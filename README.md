# MP4 to MP3 Converter

This is a simple MP4 to MP3 converter project built with Node.js, Express.js, and Docker. It allows users to upload MP4 files, convert them to MP3 format, and store the converted files in a PostgreSQL database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mp4-to-mp3-converter.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd mp4-to-mp3-converter

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and configure your environment variables. You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a template.

4. Build and start the Docker containers:
   docker-compose up --build

This command will start the Node.js application, PostgreSQL database, and other required services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running Migrations

To run database migrations inside the Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Find the container ID for the Node.js application using:

2. Execute a shell session in the container:

docker exec -it <container_id> sh

Replace `<container_id>` with the actual ID of the Node.js container.

3. Once inside the container, navigate to the project directory:

4. Run the Knex migrations:

npm run knex migrate:latest

This command will create the necessary database tables.

## Project Suggestions

Here are some suggestions for improving the project:

- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication to secure the application. You can use Passport.js with various strategies like JWT or OAuth.
- **Logging**: Add a logging mechanism to track application events and errors. Libraries like Winston or Bunyan can be helpful.
- **File Validation**: Implement file type validation to ensure that only valid MP4 files are accepted.
- **File Cleanup**: Implement a mechanism to delete temporary and unused files to free up storage space.
- **File Storage**: Consider using cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for storing converted MP3 files.
- **User Management**: Create a user management system to allow users to manage their converted files.
- **UI Improvements**: Enhance the user interface to provide a better user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected issues.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Feel free to explore and expand this project based on your requirements and learning goals.
